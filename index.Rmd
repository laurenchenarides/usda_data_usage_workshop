## About this Workshop

**Why Are We Here?** To introduce the [DemocratizingData.ai](https://democratizingdata.ai/tools/dashboards/) platform and the uses of its dashboard to research-oriented agricultural economists. 

**What Is It?** The DemocratizingData.ai platform is being developed to track data usage statistics for datasets produced by the USDA. 

**What Is Our Goal Today?** To gather feedback from invited participants about the current functionality of the USDA dashboard and potential future improvements. 

**How Will We Get There?** The format of the workshop is guided focus groups and interactive discussions designed for attendees to contribute to shaping the ongoing developments of the tool.
