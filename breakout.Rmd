## Activity #1 

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">**Total Time: 15 minutes**</span>

In today’s rapidly evolving research landscape, the ability to quickly and effectively find relevant datasets can be the difference between publishing in a top field journal or spending months finding the right publication home; securing funding for that highly competitive research grant or not; and spending hours instead of days searching for the right tool for your research project. 

We recognize the challenges associated with sorting through vast amounts of available datasets. Initiatives, like DemocratizingData.ai, are being developed to simplify components of this process. These efforts require contributions from the community, which is why we have convened this workshop.

This first activity aims to explore these opportunities by conceptualizing an ideal tool for tracking dataset usage statistics. Understanding these statistics informs the public about the relevance and impact of various datasets, and provides information to researchers about the most widely-used (and under-utilized) resources for their work. 


### Thought Experiment

To conceptualize this ideal tool, we will engage in a role-playing scenario designed to mimic the decision-making process researchers face when selecting datasets for their studies.

**Scenario:** Assume you have become aware of a new (to you) dataset and you want to understand whether it is useful for your research and how others have used it.

**Objective:** We will now walk through a series of questions to understand your decision-making process in determining its usefulness to you.

**Instructions:** For answering the questions, we'll use Idea Boards, an online collaboration tool that allows participants to share their thoughts and insights through sticky notes. 

Here’s a quick guide on how to use Idea Boards:

Please navigate to your group's Idea Board:

| Breakout Group   | Link to Idea Board | 
|--------|----------------|
| Group 1  | [Idea Board 1](https://ideaboardz.com/for/Group%201/5264531)         | 
| Group 2  | [Idea Board 2](https://ideaboardz.com/for/Group%202/5264537)         | 
| Group 3  | [Idea Board 3](https://ideaboardz.com/for/Group%203/5264539)         | 
| Group 4  | [Idea Board 4](https://ideaboardz.com/for/Group%204/5264540)         | 
Here’s a quick guide on how to use Idea Boards:

- Navigate to the provided link to access our group’s Idea Board.

- Once there, you’ll find different columns or sections, each representing a specific question or part of our discussion.

- To add your input, click on the ‘Add Note’ button or double-click in the column where you want to post your sticky note.

- You can type your thoughts and click 'Save' to share them with the group.

- Feel free to move your notes around, edit them as the discussion evolves, or "up vote" other sticky notes.


### Questions

1. What key pieces of information would you want to know about the usage of this dataset?

    - Add your responses as sticky notes to the "Pieces of Information" Idea Board. 
    - Time: 3 minutes

2. Are there tools / resources that can provide you with the information you want?  

    - Add your responses as sticky notes to the "Tools / Resources" Idea Board. 
    - Time: 3 minutes

3. What features in a tool / resource exist or would you like to see exist to help you compare datasets? 
what features should / does a tool / resource have to help you decide if the dataset is useful? 
    - Add your responses as sticky notes to the "Features" Idea Board. 
    - Time: 3 minutes
    

### Quick Poll

## Activity #2 

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">**Total Time: 23 minutes**</span>

Now you will explore the utility and functionality of the prototype dashboard on your own. This activity is designed to highlight different aspects of the dashboard and how you can use it to collect data usage statistics.

### Using the Dashboard 

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">**Time: 15 minutes**</span>

**Objective:** You will use the dashboard to find information about the dataset assigned to your breakout group (see table below). You will be asked a series of questions that are aimed to find specific data usage statistics for your assigned dataset. Answer the specific questions associated with the tasks presented. We will reconvene as a small group to reflect on your experience with the dashboard.
