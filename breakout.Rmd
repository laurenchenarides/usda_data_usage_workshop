## Introductions

Welcome, everyone! Before we dive into the first session, let's start off with a quick icebreaker. 

Please introduce yourself by sharing:

- Your name

- The institution or organization you're affiliated with

- Your "sheep score" – Each sheep represents a different mood or feeling. Choose the sheep that best represents how you feel today

## Activity #1

In today’s rapidly evolving research landscape, the ability to quickly and effectively find relevant datasets can be the difference between publishing in a top field journal or spending months finding the right publication home; securing funding for that highly competitive research grant or not; and spending hours instead of days searching for the right tool for your research project. 

We recognize the challenges associated with sorting through vast amounts of available datasets. Initiatives, like DemocratizingData.ai, are being developed to simplify components of this process. These efforts require contributions from the community, which is why we have convened this workshop.

This first activity aims to explore these opportunities by conceptualizing an ideal tool for tracking dataset usage statistics. Understanding dataset usage statistics informs the public about the relevance and impact of various datasets, and provides information to researchers about the most widely-used (and under-utilized) resources for their work. 

<!--
Through this first activity, we will delve into how such a tool could transform your research workflows, enhance collaboration opportunities, and significantly improve research outcomes.

## Thought Experiment
<!--
***Imagine a tool that could instantly reveal the datasets, researchers, institutions, and focus areas behind the publications driving your research. How much time could you save, and how could this change the way you approach your research?***
As we begin this thought experiment, consider yourself not just as a user, but as a key contributor whose insights could significantly influence the development of this dashboard.
-->

**Scenario:** Assume that you are new to a certain field of study and you want to do research in this area. You seek out an expert in that field and ask them to suggest datasets you could use to answer your research question. They suggest two datasets you could use. You may only select one.

**Objective:** We will now walk through a series of questions to understand your decision-making process in determining which, of the two, datasets you would ultimately choose.

1. What key pieces of information would you need to compare the two datasets?

2. What questions would you be asking yourself during this process?

3. Does a tool exist that could help you compare the datasets?

    - If yes, what is the tool and how have you used it?

    - If not, what features would you like to see in a tool to help you make this decision?

4. Consider a feature that identifies dataset-specific experts and their institutions.
   - How valuable would this feature be in making your decision?
   - In what ways could this information offer insights?
   - Would knowing this answer influence your choice of dataset?

5. Consider a feature that has direct links to research articles using the suggested datasets.
   - How valuable would this feature be in making your decision?
   - In what ways could this information offer insights?
   - Would knowing this answer influence your choice of dataset?

<!--
### Reflect on Your Current Process

1. **Identify Your Needs**
   - Reflect on the last time you were in search of data for your research. What were the key pieces of information you were trying to find?
   - Modality: List - white board with sticky notes (on your own)
   - Time Limit: 
   

2. **Understand Your Motivations**
   - Why were you searching for this data? 
   - What questions were you asking yourself during this process?
   - Modality: Discussion (while looking at the list)
   - Time Limit: 
   
   Examples:
     - Were you looking to see how others have used the dataset?
     - Were you curious about the publications or researchers associated with the dataset?

### Envisioning the Ideal Tool

3. **Time-Saving Features**
   - Given the piece of information in question #1, what feature would save you time or enhance your search to find the ideal dataset? 
   - How would this features change your research process?
   - Modality: Board that is discussion-based
   - Time Limit: *how do we get at this quickly while brainstorming?*

4. **Broadening Your Research Network**
   - Consider how a tool that identifies data experts and institutions involved in similar research areas could impact your work. 
   - Would this facilitate collaboration? 
   - Would it offer new insights?
   - Modality: Poll

5. **Access to Publications**
   - How valuable would it be to have direct links to research articles using specific USDA datasets? 
   - Would this influence your choice of datasets?
   - Modality: Poll

## Activity #2

In this second activity, we will introduce you to a dashboard whose functions are to: 

- Identify experts who use USDA-produced datasets 

- Retrieve publications using USDA-produced datasets

- Search for dataset users and publications by topic area

Then, we will walk through a series of role-play exercises to simulate real-world scenarios you might encounter throughout your research process. These scenarios will help us explore the utility and functionality of the prototype dashboard. Each scenario is crafted to highlight different aspects of the dashboard and how it can assist in various research activities such as finding collaborators, writing grants, doing the research and publishing.

**Objective:** To understand the dashboard's potential impact on your research workflows and decision-making processes. 

## Scenarios

Please follow along as we navigate through each scenario, reflecting on the specific questions and tasks presented.
