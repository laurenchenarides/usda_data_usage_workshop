## Session Objective

***Imagine a tool that could instantly reveal the datasets, researchers, institutions, and focus areas behind the publications driving your research. How much time could you save, and how could this change the way you approach your research?***

In todayâ€™s rapidly evolving research landscape, the ability to quickly and effectively find relevant data can be the difference between publishing in a top field journal or spending months finding the right publication home; securing funding for that highly competitive research grant or not; and spending hours instead of days searching for the right tool for your research project. The sheer volume of data available poses a significant challenge, but it also offers opportunities for those who can navigate this complex information ecosystem efficiently to develop technology advancements. 

This session aims to explore these opportunities by conceptualizing an ideal tool for data discovery. Through this first activity, we will delve into how such a tool could transform your research workflows, enhance collaboration opportunities, and significantly improve research outcomes.

## Getting Started

As we begin this thought experiment, consider yourself not just as a user, but as a key contributor whose insights could significantly influence the development of this dashboard.

### Reflect on Your Current Process

1. **Identify Your Needs**
   - Reflect on the last time you were in search of data for your research. What were the key pieces of information you were trying to find? Consider aspects such as:
     - Statistics or specific data points
     - Limitations or scope of the datasets
     - Coverage or inclusiveness of the data

2. **Understand Your Motivations**
   - Why were you searching for this data? What questions were you asking yourself during this process?
     - Were you looking to see how others have used the dataset?
     - Were you curious about the publications or researchers associated with the dataset?

### Envisioning the Ideal Tool

3. **Time-Saving Features**
   - Given your experience, list features that would have saved you time or enhanced your search for the ideal dataset. How would these features change your research process?

4. **Broadening Your Research Network**
   - Consider how a tool that identifies data experts and institutions involved in similar research areas could impact your work. Would this facilitate collaboration or offer new insights?

5. **Access to Publications**
   - How valuable would it be to have direct links to research articles using specific USDA datasets? Would this influence your choice of datasets?

### Your Role in Shaping the Dashboard

6. **Feedback and Suggestions**
   - Based on your envisioned ideal tool, what suggestions do you have for the prototype USDA dashboard? Think about the search functionality, user interface, and any other aspects that would make the dashboard more useful for you and other researchers.

7. **Discussion**
   - Share your thoughts and suggestions with the class. What common features are most desired, and how do these align with the objectives of the USDA-funded dashboard?
