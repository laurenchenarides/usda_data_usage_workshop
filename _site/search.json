      "description": "The purpose of this workshop is to introduce the [DemocratizingData.ai](https://democratizingdata.ai/tools/dashboards/) platform and the uses of its dashboard to research-oriented agricultural economists. The DemocratizingData.ai platform has been developed to track data usage statistics for USDA data assets. The goal of the workshop is to gather feedback from invited participants about the current functionality of the USDA dashboard and potential future improvements. The format of the workshop is guided focus groups and interactive discussions designed for attendees to contribute to shaping the ongoing developments of the tool.\n\nThe workshop is led by agricultural economists Drs. [Allie Bauman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KsJSnW4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Alessandro Bonanno](https://agsci.colostate.edu/old-dare/people/faculty/dr-alessandro-bonanno/), [Lauren Chenarides](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurenchenarides/), and [Rebecca Cleary](https://agsci.colostate.edu/old-dare/people/faculty/dr-rebecca-cleary/) from Colorado State University. The workshop facilitator is Dr. [Mayla Boguslav](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayla-boguslav-phd-30402239/).\n\nThe workshop is supported by funding from the USDA Economic Research Service.\n",

Let’s start off with a quick icebreaker.\r\nPlease introduce yourself by sharing:\r\nYour name\r\nThe institution or organization you’re affiliated with\r\nYour “sheep score” – Each sheep represents a different mood or feeling. Choose the sheep that best represents how you feel today.\r\nOn this sheep-scale, how do you feel today?Activity #1\r\nTotal Time: 15 minutes\r\nIn today’s rapidly evolving research landscape, the ability to quickly and effectively find relevant datasets can be the difference between publishing in a top field journal or spending months finding the right publication home; securing funding for that highly competitive research grant or not; and spending hours instead of days searching for the right tool for your research project.\r\nWe recognize the challenges associated with sorting through vast amounts of available datasets. Initiatives, like DemocratizingData.ai, are being developed to simplify components of this process. These efforts require contributions from the community, which is why we have convened this workshop.\r\nThis first activity aims to explore these opportunities by conceptualizing an ideal tool for tracking dataset usage statistics. Understanding these statistics informs the public about the relevance and impact of various datasets, and provides information to researchers about the most widely-used (and under-utilized) resources for their work.\r\nThought Experiment\r\nTo conceptualize this ideal tool, we will engage in a role-playing scenario designed to mimic the decision-making process researchers face when selecting datasets for their studies.\r\nScenario: Assume that you are new to a certain field of study and you want to do research in this area. You seek out an expert in that field and ask them to suggest datasets you could use to answer your research question. They suggest two datasets you could use. You may only select one.\r\nObjective: We will now walk through a series of questions to understand your decision-making process in determining which, of the two, datasets you would ultimately choose.\r\nInstructions: For answering the questions, we’ll use Idea Boards, an online collaboration tool that allows participants to share their thoughts and insights through sticky notes.\r\nHere’s a quick guide on how to use Idea Boards:\r\nNavigate to the provided link to access our group’s Idea Board.\r\nOnce there, you’ll find different columns or sections, each representing a specific question or part of our discussion.\r\nTo add your input, click on the ‘Add Note’ button or double-click in the column where you want to post your sticky note.\r\nYou can type your thoughts and click ‘Save’ to share them with the group.\r\nFeel free to move your notes around, edit them as the discussion evolves, or ``up vote’’ other sticky notes.\r\nPlease navigate to your group’s Idea Board:\r\nBreakout Group\r\nLink to Idea Board\r\nGroup 1\r\nIdea Board 1\r\nGroup 2\r\nIdea Board 2\r\nGroup 3\r\nIdea Board 3\r\nGroup 4\r\nIdea Board 4\r\nQuestions\r\nWhat key pieces of information would you need to compare the two datasets?\r\nAdd your responses as sticky notes to the “Pieces of Information” Idea Board.\r\nTime: 3 minutes\r\n\r\nWhat tools exist to help you compare datasets?\r\nAdd your responses as sticky notes to the “Existing Tools” Idea Board.\r\nTime: 3 minutes\r\n\r\nWhat features in a tool exist or would you like to see exist to help you compare datasets?\r\nAdd your responses as sticky notes to the “Features” Idea Board.\r\nTime: 3 minutes\r\n\r\nQuick Poll\r\n\r\n\r\nLoading…\r\n\r\nLink to poll\r\nDashboard Walkthrough\r\nTotal Time: 7 minutes\r\nNow, we will walk you through a dashboard that provides data usage information about USDA datasets. The primary functions of the dashboard include:\r\nIdentifying users of USDA-produced datasets by region, institution, and field\r\nProviding information on publications and citations featuring USDA-produced datasets\r\nWorkshop User Guide\r\n\r\n\r\nThe guide above walks through the current version of the Democratizing Data dashboard.\r\nDemocratizing Data User Guide\r\n\r\n\r\nThe guide above provides additional information developed by the Democratizing Data team. Link to guide\r\nActivity #2\r\nTotal Time: 23 minutes\r\nNow you will explore the utility and functionality of the prototype dashboard on your own. This activity is designed to highlight different aspects of the dashboard and how you can use it to collect data usage statistics.\r\nUsing the Dashboard\r\nTime: 15 minutes\r\nObjective: You will use the dashboard to find information about the dataset assigned to your breakout group (see table below). You will be asked a series of questions that are aimed to find specific data usage statistics for your assigned dataset. Answer the specific questions associated with the tasks presented. We will reconvene as a small group to reflect on your experience with the dashboard.\r\nBreakout Group\r\nAssigned Dataset\r\nGroup 1\r\nCensus of Agriculture\r\nGroup 2\r\nFoodAPS\r\nGroup 3\r\nCurrent Population Survey – Food Security Supplement\r\nGroup 4\r\nFood Access Research Atlas\r\nTasks\r\nUPDATE SCENARIOS TO MATCH THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SITE\r\nUSE CONSISTENT PHRASING TO HAVE THEM ANSWER QUESTIONS WHERE WE KNOW THE RIGHT ANSWERS\r\nHAVE THEM FIND THE “RIGHT ANSWER”\r\nAs you navigate the dashboard to answer the questions below, please make use of the chat feature in Zoom to provide comments, in real time, about your experience. Our note takers will be collecting your feedback.\r\nLocate your assigned dataset: Given the USDA-produced dataset have you been assigned, navigate to the location on the page where you can filter through the list of datasets.\r\nExample dataset: Farm to School Census\r\nIdentify an expert: Who can we ask for help?\r\nAnswer: Becca Jablonski\r\nIdentify five papers we can read: What papers can we read?\r\nAnswer: Big Hunger\r\nWhere is a good place to do a literature review?\r\nAnswer: Journal of Hunger and Environmental Nutrition\r\nWhere might publish?\r\nAnswer:\r\nBut, what if I want to target an Ag Econ journal?\r\nAnswer: Go to “All Science Journal Classification Subfields”, Select “Economics and Econometrics”\r\nIf time allows, clear your filter and pick a new dataset.\r\nReflection Questions\r\nTime: 8 minutes\r\nAfter you have gone through the dashboard and answered the questions, let’s review the following questions as a group. Note takers, please document the responses to share with the larger group.\r\nWhat features of the dashboard did you find particularly useful or surprising?\r\nWhat limitations or problems did you encounter while navigating the dashboard?\r\nWhat features would you add to the dashboard?\r\nThank you for sharing. We will now reconvene with the rest of the participants to share your reflections from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGo to Large Group Share\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The USDA and their partners are developing a dashboard to track who and how USDA-produced datasets are used by the public, an initiative inspired by the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018. The purpose of this workshop is to collect feedback from prospective users of the dashboard, and to use these comments to refine and improve the dashboard to better serve the needs of the research community.\r\nA Special Welcome from Julia Lane\r\n\r\nClick the image above to watch a welcome video from Julia Lane, one of the creators of the Democratizing Data project.\r\nWhy Your Participation Matters\r\nResearch Value: Your engagement is central to the development process. As a research-oriented agricultural economist, your insights and feedback will directly influence the development of this platform, ensuring it aligns with the actual needs of the community. Your contributions today will inform the platform’s future enhancements, making it more intuitive and valuable for researchers like you.\r\nNetworking and Knowledge Sharing Value: This workshop is designed to be interactive and discussion-based, bringing together research-active agricultural economists. It represents a unique opportunity to connect, share knowledge, and learn from your peers—some of whom you may already know and others you are yet to meet. We hope these interactions foster a sense of community and collaboration.\r\nCommunity Impact: The exclusivity of this workshop, limited to 40 agricultural economists, highlights the curated nature of this event. Your nomination to participate is a testament to the value we believe you bring to these discussions. Together, we have the potential to shape a tool that will serve not just our immediate needs but also set a benchmark for data discovery and application in policy oriented research.\r\nWorkshop Flow\r\nTime: 5 minutes Led by: Allie Bauman\r\nThe workshop is being led by a team from Colorado State University. The majority of the workshop will be spent in breakout groups. Each breakout group will have a discussant and a note taker. You will be assigned to a breakout group based on your research area or sub-discipline specialty. Participants will take part in two activities within their breakout rooms. All participants will reconvene to share their experience toward the end of the workshop. The workshop moderator will keep track of time and inform breakout groups how much time remains within the breakout rooms.\r\nBreakout Groups\r\nTime: 3 minutes Led by: Rebecca Cleary\r\nYou will now be organized into one of four breakout groups.\r\nBreakout Group\r\nTeam Lead\r\nNote Taker\r\nGroup 1\r\nAllie Bauman\r\nBrooke Fitzgerald\r\nGroup 2\r\nBecky Cleary\r\nTaís de Menezes\r\nGroup 3\r\nAlessandro Bonanno\r\nMackenzie Gill\r\nGroup 4\r\nLauren Chenarides\r\nSione Ikeme\r\nWe value your perspective in shaping the development of a tool. We look forward to your active participation, insightful discussions, and feedback during this workshop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGo to Breakout Groups\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
