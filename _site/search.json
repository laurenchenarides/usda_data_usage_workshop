      "description": "The purpose of this workshop is to introduce the [DemocratizingData.ai](https://democratizingdata.ai/tools/dashboards/) platform and the uses of its dashboard to research-oriented agricultural economists. The DemocratizingData.ai platform has been developed to track data usage statistics for USDA data assets. The goal of the workshop is to gather feedback from invited participants about the current functionality of the USDA dashboard and potential future improvements. The format of the workshop is guided focus groups and interactive discussions designed for attendees to contribute to shaping the ongoing developments of the tool.\n\nThe workshop is led by agricultural economists Drs. [Allie Bauman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KsJSnW4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Alessandro Bonanno](https://agsci.colostate.edu/old-dare/people/faculty/dr-alessandro-bonanno/), [Lauren Chenarides](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurenchenarides/), and [Rebecca Cleary](https://agsci.colostate.edu/old-dare/people/faculty/dr-rebecca-cleary/) from Colorado State University. The workshop facilitator is Dr. [Mayla Boguslav](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayla-boguslav-phd-30402239/).\n\nThe workshop is supported by funding from the USDA Economic Research Service.\n",

Before we dive into the first session, let’s start off with a quick icebreaker.\r\nPlease introduce yourself by sharing:\r\nYour name\r\nThe institution or organization you’re affiliated with\r\nYour “sheep score” – Each sheep represents a different mood or feeling. Choose the sheep that best represents how you feel today\r\nOn this sheep-scale, how do you feel today?Activity #1\r\nIn today’s rapidly evolving research landscape, the ability to quickly and effectively find relevant datasets can be the difference between publishing in a top field journal or spending months finding the right publication home; securing funding for that highly competitive research grant or not; and spending hours instead of days searching for the right tool for your research project.\r\nWe recognize the challenges associated with sorting through vast amounts of available datasets. Initiatives, like DemocratizingData.ai, are being developed to simplify components of this process. These efforts require contributions from the community, which is why we have convened this workshop.\r\nThis first activity aims to explore these opportunities by conceptualizing an ideal tool for tracking dataset usage statistics. Understanding dataset usage statistics informs the public about the relevance and impact of various datasets, and provides information to researchers about the most widely-used (and under-utilized) resources for their work.\r\n\r\nThought Experiment\r\n(15 minutes)\r\n\r\nScenario: Assume that you are new to a certain field of study and you want to do research in this area. You seek out an expert in that field and ask them to suggest datasets you could use to answer your research question. They suggest two datasets you could use. You may only select one.\r\nObjective: We will now walk through a series of questions to understand your decision-making process in determining which, of the two, datasets you would ultimately choose.\r\nBreakout Group\r\nLink to Idea Board\r\nGroup 1\r\nIdea Board 1\r\nGroup 2\r\nIdea Board 2\r\nGroup 3\r\nIdea Board 3\r\nGroup 4\r\nIdea Board 4\r\nWhat key pieces of information would you need to compare the two datasets?\r\nAdd your responses as sticky notes to the “Pieces of Information” Idea Board.\r\n\r\nWhat tools exist to help you compare datasets? What features in a tool exist or would you like to see exist to help you compare datasets?\r\nAdd your responses as sticky notes to the “Existing Tools” and “Features” Idea Board.\r\n\r\nConsider a feature that identifies dataset-specific experts and their institutions.\r\nHow valuable would this feature be in making your decision? [Poll]\r\nWould knowing this answer influence your choice of dataset? [Poll]\r\n\r\nConsider a feature that has direct links to research articles using the suggested datasets.\r\nHow valuable would this feature be in making your decision? [Poll]\r\nWould knowing this answer influence your choice of dataset? [Poll]\r\n\r\nActivity #2\r\nIn this second activity, we will walk you through a dashboard that provides data usage information about USDA datasets. The primary functions of the dashboard include:\r\nIdentifying users of USDA-produced datasets by region, institution, and field\r\nProviding information on publications and citations featuring USDA-produced datasets\r\nObjective: To understand the dashboard’s potential impact on your research workflows and decision-making processes.\r\nSite Walkthrough\r\n(7 minutes)\r\n\r\n\r\nChoose a Scenario\r\n(13 minutes)\r\nNow you will explore the utility and functionality of the prototype dashboard on your own. This activity is designed to highlight different aspects of the dashboard and how it can assist in various research activities.\r\nPlease navigate through the assigned scenario on your own, reflecting on the specific questions and tasks presented. We will reconvene to reflect on your experience with the dashboard.\r\nUPDATE SCENARIOS TO MATCH THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SITE\r\nUSE CONSISTENT PHRASING TO HAVE THEM ANSWER QUESTIONS WHERE WE KNOW THE RIGHT ANSWERS\r\nBreakout Group\r\nLink to Scenario\r\nGroup 1\r\nScenario 1\r\nGroup 2\r\nScenario 2\r\nGroup 3\r\nScenario 3\r\nGroup 4\r\nScenario 4\r\nReflection\r\n(10 minutes)\r\nHOW DO WE WANT TO GO THROUGH THESE?\r\nConsider the following questions:\r\nWhat features of the dashboard did you find particularly useful or surprising?\r\nWhat limitations or problems did you encounter while navigating the dashboard?\r\nWhat features would you add to the dashboard?\r\nWould you use this tool in your own research? Why or why not?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBack to Top\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The USDA and their partners are developing a dashboard to track who and how USDA-produced datasets are used by the public, an initiative inspired by the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018.\r\nThe purpose of this workshop is to collect feedback from prospective users of the dashboard, and to use these comments to refine and improve the dashboard to better serve the needs of the research community.\r\nA Special Welcome from Julia Lane\r\n\r\nClick the image above to watch a welcome video from Julia Lane, one of the creators of the Democratizing Data project.\r\nWhy Your Participation Matters\r\nResearch Value: Your engagement is central to the development process. As a research-oriented agricultural economist, your insights and feedback will directly influence the development of this platform, ensuring it aligns with the actual needs of the community. Your contributions today will inform the platform’s future enhancements, making it more intuitive and valuable for researchers like you.\r\nNetworking and Knowledge Sharing Value: This workshop is designed to be interactive and discussion-based, bringing together research-active agricultural economists. It represents a unique opportunity to connect, share knowledge, and learn from your peers—some of whom you may already know and others you are yet to meet. We hope these interactions foster a sense of community and collaboration.\r\nCommunity Impact: The exclusivity of this workshop, limited to 40 agricultural economists, highlights the curated nature of this event. Your nomination to participate is a testament to the value we believe you bring to these discussions. Together, we have the potential to shape a tool that will serve not just our immediate needs but also set a benchmark for data discovery and application in policy oriented research.\r\nMoving Forward\r\nWe value your perspective in shaping the development of a tool. We look forward to your active participation, insightful discussions, and feedback during this workshop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBack to Top\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
