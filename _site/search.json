      "description": "The purpose of this workshop is to introduce the [DemocratizingData.ai](https://democratizingdata.ai/tools/dashboards/) platform and the uses of its dashboard to research-oriented agricultural economists. The DemocratizingData.ai platform has been developed to track data usage statistics for USDA data assets. The goal of the workshop is to gather feedback from invited participants about the current functionality of the USDA dashboard and potential future improvements. The format of the workshop is guided focus groups and interactive discussions designed for attendees to contribute to shaping the ongoing developments of the tool.\n\nThe workshop is led by agricultural economists Drs. [Allie Bauman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allie-bauman-21a7b299/), [Alessandro Bonanno](https://agsci.colostate.edu/old-dare/people/faculty/dr-alessandro-bonanno/), [Rebecca Cleary](https://agsci.colostate.edu/old-dare/people/faculty/dr-rebecca-cleary/), and [Lauren Chenarides](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurenchenarides/) from Colorado State University. The workshop facilitator is Dr. [Mayla Boguslav](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayla-boguslav-phd-30402239/).\n\nThe workshop is supported by funding from the USDA Economic Research Service.\n",

      "contents": "\r\nSession Objective\r\nImagine a tool that could instantly reveal the datasets, researchers, institutions, and focus areas behind the publications driving your research. How much time could you save, and how could this change the way you approach your research?\r\nIn today’s rapidly evolving research landscape, the ability to quickly and effectively find relevant data can be the difference between publishing in a top field journal or spending months finding the right publication home; securing funding for that highly competitive research grant or not; and spending hours instead of days searching for the right tool for your research project. The sheer volume of data available poses a significant challenge, but it also offers opportunities for those who can navigate this complex information ecosystem efficiently to develop technology advancements.\r\nThis session aims to explore these opportunities by conceptualizing an ideal tool for data discovery. Through this first activity, we will delve into how such a tool could transform your research workflows, enhance collaboration opportunities, and significantly improve research outcomes.\r\nGetting Started\r\nAs we begin this thought experiment, consider yourself not just as a user, but as a key contributor whose insights could significantly influence the development of this dashboard.\r\nReflect on Your Current Process\r\nIdentify Your Needs\r\nReflect on the last time you were in search of data for your research. What were the key pieces of information you were trying to find? Consider aspects such as:\r\nStatistics or specific data points\r\nLimitations or scope of the datasets\r\nCoverage or inclusiveness of the data\r\n\r\n\r\nUnderstand Your Motivations\r\nWhy were you searching for this data? What questions were you asking yourself during this process?\r\nWere you looking to see how others have used the dataset?\r\nWere you curious about the publications or researchers associated with the dataset?\r\n\r\n\r\nEnvisioning the Ideal Tool\r\nTime-Saving Features\r\nGiven your experience, list features that would have saved you time or enhanced your search for the ideal dataset. How would these features change your research process?\r\n\r\nBroadening Your Research Network\r\nConsider how a tool that identifies data experts and institutions involved in similar research areas could impact your work. Would this facilitate collaboration or offer new insights?\r\n\r\nAccess to Publications\r\nHow valuable would it be to have direct links to research articles using specific USDA datasets? Would this influence your choice of datasets?\r\n\r\nYour Role in Shaping the Dashboard\r\nFeedback and Suggestions\r\nBased on your envisioned ideal tool, what suggestions do you have for the prototype USDA dashboard? Think about the search functionality, user interface, and any other aspects that would make the dashboard more useful for you and other researchers.\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\nShare your thoughts and suggestions with the class. What common features are most desired, and how do these align with the objectives of the USDA-funded dashboard?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBack to Top\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This tool, specifically designed to enhance the search-and-discovery process for USDA data assets, is in its developmental phase. Its developers are seeking feedback from prospective users to refine and improve the dashboard to better serve researchers in their search for datasets, identification of data experts, and discovery of publications using USDA data.\r\nA Special Welcome from Julia Lane\r\n\r\nClick the image above to watch a welcome video from Julia Lane, one of the creators of the Democratizing Data project.\r\nWhy Your Participation Matters\r\nResearch Value: Your engagement is central to the development process. As a research-oriented agricultural economist, your insights and feedback will directly influence the development of this platform, ensuring it aligns with the actual needs of the community. Your contributions today will inform the platform’s future enhancements, making it more intuitive and valuable for researchers like you.\r\nNetworking and Knowledge Sharing Value: This workshop is designed to be interactive and discussion-based, bringing together research-active agricultural economists. It represents a unique opportunity to connect, share knowledge, and learn from your peers—some of whom you may already know and others you are yet to meet. We hope these interactions foster a sense of community and collaboration.\r\nCommunity Impact: The exclusivity of this workshop, limited to 40 agricultural economists, highlights the curated nature of this event. Your nomination to participate is a testament to the value we believe you bring to these discussions. Together, we have the potential to shape a tool that will serve not just our immediate needs but also set a benchmark for data discovery and application in policy oriented research.\r\nMoving Forward\r\nWe value your perspective in shaping the development of a tool. We look forward to your active participation, insightful discussions, and feedback during this workshop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBack to Top\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
