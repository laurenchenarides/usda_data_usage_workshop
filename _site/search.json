      "description": "The purpose of this workshop is to introduce the [DemocratizingData.ai](https://democratizingdata.ai/tools/dashboards/) platform and the uses of its dashboard to research-oriented agricultural economists. The DemocratizingData.ai platform has been developed to track data usage statistics for USDA data assets. The goal of the workshop is to gather feedback from invited participants about the current functionality of the USDA dashboard and potential future improvements. The format of the workshop is guided focus groups and interactive discussions designed for attendees to contribute to shaping the ongoing developments of the tool.\n\nThe workshop is led by agricultural economists Drs. [Allie Bauman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allie-bauman-21a7b299/), [Alessandro Bonanno](https://agsci.colostate.edu/old-dare/people/faculty/dr-alessandro-bonanno/), [Lauren Chenarides](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurenchenarides/), and [Rebecca Cleary](https://agsci.colostate.edu/old-dare/people/faculty/dr-rebecca-cleary/) from Colorado State University. The workshop facilitator is Dr. [Mayla Boguslav](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayla-boguslav-phd-30402239/).\n\nThe workshop is supported by funding from the USDA Economic Research Service.\n",

      "contents": "\r\nIntroductions\r\nWelcome, everyone! Before we dive into the first session, let’s start off with a quick icebreaker.\r\nTake a look at this ‘sheep-scale’. Each sheep represents a different mood or feeling.\r\nOn this sheep-scale, how do you feel today?Please introduce yourself by sharing:\r\nYour name\r\nThe institution or organization you’re affiliated with\r\nYour “sheep score” – choose the sheep that best represents how you feel today\r\nSession Overview\r\nIn today’s rapidly evolving research landscape, the ability to quickly and effectively find relevant data can be the difference between publishing in a top field journal or spending months finding the right publication home; securing funding for that highly competitive research grant or not; and spending hours instead of days searching for the right tool for your research project.\r\nWe recognize the challenges associated with sorting through vast amounts of available data. Initiatives, like DemocratizingData.ai, are being developed to simplify this process. These efforts require contributions from the community, which is why we have convened this workshop.\r\nThis session aims to explore these opportunities by conceptualizing an ideal tool for data discovery. Through this first activity, we will delve into how such a tool could transform your research workflows, enhance collaboration opportunities, and significantly improve research outcomes.\r\nThought Experiment\r\nImagine a tool that could instantly reveal the datasets, researchers, institutions, and focus areas behind the publications driving your research. How much time could you save, and how could this change the way you approach your research?\r\nAs we begin this thought experiment, consider yourself not just as a user, but as a key contributor whose insights could significantly influence the development of this dashboard.\r\n\r\nReflect on Your Current Process\r\nIdentify Your Needs\r\nReflect on the last time you were in search of data for your research. What were the key pieces of information you were trying to find?\r\nModality: List - white board with sticky notes (on your own)\r\nTime Limit:\r\n\r\nConsider aspects such as:\r\nStatistics or specific data points\r\nLimitations or scope of the datasets\r\nCoverage or inclusiveness of the data\r\n\r\nUnderstand Your Motivations\r\nWhy were you searching for this data?\r\nWhat questions were you asking yourself during this process?\r\nModality: Discussion (while looking at the list)\r\nTime Limit:\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\nWere you looking to see how others have used the dataset?\r\nWere you curious about the publications or researchers associated with the dataset?\r\n\r\nEnvisioning the Ideal Tool\r\nTime-Saving Features\r\nGiven the piece of information in question #1, what feature would save you time or enhance your search to find the ideal dataset?\r\nHow would this features change your research process?\r\nModality: Board that is discussion-based\r\nTime Limit: how do we get at this quickly while brainstorming?\r\n\r\nBroadening Your Research Network\r\nConsider how a tool that identifies data experts and institutions involved in similar research areas could impact your work.\r\nWould this facilitate collaboration?\r\nWould it offer new insights?\r\nModality: Poll\r\n\r\nAccess to Publications\r\nHow valuable would it be to have direct links to research articles using specific USDA datasets?\r\nWould this influence your choice of datasets?\r\nModality: Poll\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBack to Top\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
