      "description": "The purpose of this workshop is to introduce the [DemocratizingData.ai](https://democratizingdata.ai/tools/dashboards/) platform and the uses of its dashboard to research-oriented agricultural economists. The DemocratizingData.ai platform has been developed to track data usage statistics for USDA data assets. The goal of the workshop is to gather feedback from invited participants about the current functionality of the USDA dashboard and potential future improvements. The format of the workshop is guided focus groups and interactive discussions designed for attendees to contribute to shaping the ongoing developments of the tool.\n\nThe workshop is led by agricultural economists Drs. Allie Bauman, Alessandro Bonanno, Rebecca Cleary, and [Lauren Chenarides](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurenchenarides/) from Colorado State University. The workshop facilitator is Dr. [Mayla Boguslav](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayla-boguslav-phd-30402239/).\n\nThe workshop supported by funding from the USDA Economic Research Service.\n",
