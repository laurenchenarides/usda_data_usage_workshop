## Thank You for Joining Us!

We are delighted to have you participate in this workshop, aimed at exploring a prototype dashboard, funded by the USDA, to track data usage statistics for USDA data assets. The USDA and their partners are developing a dashboard to track *who* and *how* USDA-produced datasets are used by the public, an initiative inspired by the [Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4174). The purpose of this workshop is to collect feedback from prospective users of the dashboard, and to use these comments to refine and improve the dashboard to better serve the needs of the research community.

## Why Your Participation Matters

**Research Value**: Your engagement is central to the development process. As a research-oriented agricultural economist, your insights and feedback will directly influence the development of this platform, ensuring it aligns with the actual needs of the community. Your contributions today will inform the platform’s future enhancements, making it more intuitive and valuable for researchers like you.

**Networking and Knowledge Sharing Value**: This workshop is designed to be interactive and discussion-based, bringing together research-active agricultural economists. It represents a unique opportunity to connect, share knowledge, and learn from your peers—some of whom you may already know and others you are yet to meet. We hope these interactions foster a sense of community and collaboration.

**Community Impact**: The exclusivity of this workshop, limited to 40 agricultural economists, highlights the curated nature of this event. Your nomination to participate is a testament to the value we believe you bring to these discussions. Together, we have the potential to shape a tool that will serve not just our immediate needs but also set a benchmark for data discovery and application in policy oriented research.

## Workshop Flow

The workshop is being led by a team from Colorado State University. The majority of the workshop will be spent in breakout groups. Each breakout group will have a discussant and a note taker. You will be assigned to a breakout group based on your research area or sub-discipline specialty. Participants will take part in two activities within their breakout rooms. All participants will reconvene to share their experience toward the end of the workshop. The workshop moderator will keep track of time and inform breakout groups how much time remains within the breakout rooms.

### Breakout Groups

You will now be organized into one of four breakout groups.

| Breakout Group   | Team Lead | Note Taker | 
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Group 1  |   Allie Bauman  |  Brooke Fitzgerald    |
| Group 2  |   Becky Cleary      |  Ta&iacute;s de Menezes  |
| Group 3  |   Alessandro Bonanno    |   Mackenzie Gill  |
| Group 4  |   Lauren Chenarides   | Sione Ikeme   |


***We value your perspective in shaping the development of a tool. We look forward to your active participation, insightful discussions, and feedback during this workshop.***
