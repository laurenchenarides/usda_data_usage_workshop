**Purpose:** Imagine you're in the process of drafting a research paper and you need to identify relevant datasets for your analysis. The goal is to use the data discovery tool to find datasets that allow you to answer your research question. 

**How can the tool assist you in this scenario?**

**Tasks:**

1. **Identify Datasets:**
    - What USDA-produced datasets exist on your topic of interest? Use the tool to list the datasets you find.
    - How are the datasets classified (according to which fields)?

2. **Identify Dataset Experts:**
    - Who is using the datasets you identified, and what are their backgrounds?
    - Which regions or states have the most active users of the datasets you found?

3. **Dataset Utilization:**
    - How have these datasets been used (in what publications)? 
    - How many citations have the datasets you found received?

4. **Reflection Questions:**
    - What features of the dashboard did you find particularly useful or surprising?
    - What limitations or problems did you encounter while navigating the dashboard?
    - What features would you add to the dashboard?
    - Would you use this tool in your own research? Why or why not?
